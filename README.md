- 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas Meier, currently studying Computer Sciences and French at UW-Madison.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, walkable communities, and tech stuff overall.
- 🌱 I'm learning more about operating systems and computer graphics right now, in addition to front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on any web development projects, in addition to HCI research.
- 📫 Feel free to shoot me an email at dougmeier10@gmail.com.
