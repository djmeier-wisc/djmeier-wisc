- 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas Meier, a UW-Madison alumn living in Madison, WI.
- 👀 I’m interested in walkable communities, DnD, and distributed systems.
- 🌱 I'm learning a lot about Next.JS right now, and have become fairly familiar with Java Spring.
- 💞️ I would love to collaborate on transit related projects.
- 📫 Feel free to shoot me an email at dougmeier10@gmail.com.
